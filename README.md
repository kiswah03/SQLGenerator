# Tool for Querying Database Using a Universal Natural Language Interface
Natural Language Processing can bring powerful
enhancement to virtually any computer program interface. This
project has been developed to generate accurate and valid SQL
queries after parsing natural language using open source tools and
libraries. It aims at understanding any natural language input
statement and convert it to query. It involves understanding all natural
languages that can be inputted by the user and finding and solving
complex relationships between words and inputs given in the
